Your Excel file must contain the following columns:

I have added sample excel file  `sample_chat_messages.xlsx`

- `sender_id` - ID of the message sender
- `receiver_id` - ID of the message recipient
- `message` - Text content of the message
- `timestamp` - Date and time of the message (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

Example:

| sender_id | receiver_id | message                 | timestamp           |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1         | 2           | Hello, how are you?     | 2023-06-15 10:30:00 |
